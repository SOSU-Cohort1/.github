# Southeastern Oklahoma State University Coding Prep

Coding program to assist undergraduate developers in career growth

### Goal

Southeastern Oklahoma State University teaches a great curriculum focused on computer science technology, however, lacks career preparation at an early stage. Our goal is to provide undergraduates with experience and preparation for interviews, professional coding practices, and networking opportunities.

Program lead: Brandon Chin

### Future Goal

Extending this program to more universities that lack computer science career exposure.
